Checklists for the P-51 Mustang

Written by Chad Sebesta

# Project Goal

This project aims to collect and organize operating procedures for the venerable P-51 Mustang. It is not intended to be an authoritative source of information for aircraft operation, and is directed towards users flying in a simulator environment.

# Structure and Design

The documentation will be divided into three distinct but logical parts. Normal procedures will document ground operations and normal flight procedures. Combat procedures will document procedures unique to combat operations. Finally, emergency procedures will document the necessary procedures to deal with abnormal and emergency situations. The decision group documentation for emergency and abnormal procedures together was made in an effort to mitigate the possibility for pilot error when acting quickly to decide whether a situation constitutes an emergency and to simplify the documentation in general.
