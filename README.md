Checklists for the P-51 Mustang

Written by Chad Sebesta

# Project Goal

This project aims to collect and organize operating procedures for the venerable P-51 Mustang. It is not intended to be an authoritative source of information for aircraft operation, and is directed towards users flying in a simulator environment.

# Structure and Design

### Logical Parts

The documentation will be divided into three distinct but logical parts. Normal procedures will document ground operations and normal flight procedures. Combat procedures will document procedures unique to combat operations. Finally, emergency procedures will document the necessary procedures to deal with abnormal and emergency situations. The decision group documentation for emergency and abnormal procedures together was made in an effort to mitigate the possibility for pilot error when acting quickly to decide whether a situation constitutes an emergency and to simplify the documentation in general.

The three major parts will be further subdivided in what is intended to be a logical manner. For example, operations taking place on the ground will typically be on a single page or set of pages, with operations in the air on another. The procedures themselves are designed according to the "flow" of aircraft operation. A singe procedure is intended to be completed without interupption by distractions from outside the cockpit, and without the necessity to complete unrelated actions in the middle of completing the procedure.

### Documentation Standards

Efforts have been made to apply standards for  suggested from a variety of sources.
